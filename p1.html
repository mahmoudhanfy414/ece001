Digital life is augmenting human capacities and disrupting eons-old human activities.
Code-driven systems have spread to more than half of the world’s inhabitants in ambient
information and connectivity, offering previously unimagined opportunities and unprecedented threats.
As emerging algorithm-driven artificial intelligence (AI) continues to spread,
will people be better off than they are today?

Some 979 technology pioneers, innovators, developers, business and policy leaders,
researchers and activists answered this question in a canvassing of experts conducted in the summer of 2018.


The experts predicted networked artificial intelligence will amplify human effectiveness but also threaten human autonomy,
agency and capabilities. They spoke of the wide-ranging possibilities;
that computers might match or even exceed human intelligence and capabilities on tasks such as complex decision-making,
reasoning and learning, sophisticated analytics and pattern recognition, visual acuity,
speech recognition and language translation. They said “smart” systems in communities, in vehicles,
in buildings and utilities, on farms and in business processes will save time,
money and lives and offer opportunities for individuals to enjoy a more-customized future.

Many focused their optimistic remarks on health care and the many possible applications of AI in diagnosing 
and treating patients or helping senior citizens live fuller
and healthier lives. They were also enthusiastic about AI’s role in
contributing to broad public-health programs built around massive amounts of data that may be
captured in the coming years about everything from personal genomes to nutrition. Additionally, 
a number of these experts predicted that AI would abet long-anticipated changes in formal and informal education systems.
Yet, most experts, regardless of whether they are optimistic or not, expressed concerns about the long-term impact of
these new tools on the essential elements of being human. All respondents in this non-scientific canvassing were asked
to elaborate on why they felt AI would leave people better off or not. Many shared deep worries, and many also suggested 
pathways toward solutions. The main themes they sounded about threats and remedies are outlined in the accompanying table.
